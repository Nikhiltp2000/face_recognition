#haarcascade classifier
  
  Haar Cascade Classifier is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video. The algorithm uses edge or line detection features
  The algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) to train the classifier.
  Then we need to extract features from it.
